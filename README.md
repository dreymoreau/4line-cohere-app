In progress!

# Optimizations

- teach a data model how to only output 4 line poems each and everytime, giving the user the option to input only the subject matter for ex. "trees"
- separate components into separate files to add a better structure to the project
- authentication, give a user the ability to login and logout, having the poems that generated saved to their profile, if wanting to come back to them
